# CR7T_Connectivity
This folder contains all the code used in our manuscript:
"Network topology of symbolic and nonsymbolic number comparison" - Benjamin Conrad, Eric Wilkey, Darren Yeo, and Gavin Price.

Data preprocessing and beta series estimation is conducted primarily with AFNI tools, called from MATLAB, thus requires AFNI to be installed on the machine.

Connectivity matrix creation and statistical analyses are conducted in MATLAB, with algorithmic implementations of Louvain modularity/consensus-clustering/etc from the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/).

External functions and toolboxes are included.
